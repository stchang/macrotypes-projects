# macrotypes-projects [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stchang/macrotypes-projects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stchang/macrotypes-projects)

Projects using [Turnstile+](https://github.com/stchang/macrotypes) and/or the "types-as-macros" approach to creating typed languages.

- [Cur](https://github.com/wilbowma/cur):
  An extensible Coq-inspired proof assistant.

- [MLish](https://github.com/stchang/mlish):
  A language in the OCaml family with an extensible type
  system. Implement and use new features like GADTs and type classes
  as user libraries.

- [Typed Video](https://github.com/videolang/typed-video):
  A typed variant of the [Video language](https://lang.video/) that adds [Dependent ML](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/DML/DML.html)-style indexed types.

- [Typed Rosette](https://github.com/stchang/typed-rosette):
  An typed version of [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/index.html) that guards against lifted symbolic flowing into unlifted contexts.
	
- [CBPV Scheme](https://github.com/maxsnew/modal-scheme):
  A Scheme variant with [call-by-push-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value) semantics.

- [Typed Syndicate](https://syndicate-lang.org/):
  An actor-based language supporting a "conversational" model of concurrency.

- [Hackett](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/hackett/):
  A language integrating Racket macros and Haskell types.
